1. Passenger View
This view will include passenger details along with their booking information. This will be used by airport security as well as airport desk staff to ensure the passenger is who they say they are as well as to ensure the passenger gets the correct seat on the flight. It could also be used by the marketing team to send personalized advertisements based on previous bookings made by the passenger and promotions to "premium" customers (those that have booked business or first class tickets before).

3. Flight View
This view will include flight details along with ticket and seat information.
